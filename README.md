#IMPACT OF FOREST COVER LOSS ON RIVER FLOW REGIME IN COLOMBIA
PROJECT PROPOSAL / TEAM 28 / DS4A COLOMBIA 2020

##Description of the problem to be solved During the last century, most rivers developed significant changes in their flow regime, especially during the last decades, which are mainly attributed to forest cover loss, and to the climate change. However, in countries like Colombia, there are no studies based on actual data that stablish (quantify) the relation between forest cover loss and changes in the flow regime of the rivers, so environmental authorities and water resources planners, as well as designers of extensive infrastructure works, have no strong data to take into account the impact of possible forest cover loss when they are dealing with infrastructure works such as bridges, highways, rural roads or flood control works. It also means they can't develop a proper flood risk assessment.

##Why is this problem important? If the real relation between forest loss and changes in the flow regime of the rivers can’t be stablish, the environmental authorities can’t take informed decisions about protected areas, forest harvesting and/or reforestation, as well as about the planning of flood protection works for urban and rural areas, and can’t stablish the adequate environmental compensation they have to do in order to not alter the river flow regime, to guaranty that there will not be bigger floods due to the planned works. Additionally, the more natural the flow regime is in a river, the easier and cheaper is to regulate the hydropower generation, which is quite important in a country like Colombia.

##What are the data sets needed to solve the problem? Taken into account that the length of records for most hydrological stations in Colombia cover in average the last 25 years, and the availability of the forest cover change map for the period 2000-2019, the period of time considered for this project will be 2000-2019. The data sets required are:
•The data of the IDEAM stations.
•The catchment area for each of 316 basins define by IDEAM.
•The drainage characteristics of the soils in those catchments.
•The area of forest loss in those catchments.

##What type of external data may be of interest to the problem? The impact projected in the precipitation due to climate change.

##Expected results of the project In a first stage, a descriptive model that shows the variation in the maximum and minimum river flow due to different percentage of forest cover loss for most rivers in Colombia. In a second stage, a predictive model that estimates the expected variation in the maximum and minimum river flow due to different percentage of forest cover loss expected in the catchment area for most rivers in Colombia.
